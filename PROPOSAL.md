# CS 126 Final Project Proposal

## Basics: Develop a simple Shoot 'em Up game using SDL.
I'm trying to build a simple shooter game with openFrameworks that:
* Have multiple enemies
* Have at least one boss that performs more complicate actions
* Have music
* Have dialogs
* Have a leaderboard

## The Library
I'll be using SDL(Simple DirectMedia Layer) for this project.

>(SDL) is a cross-platform software development library designed to provide a hardware abstraction layer for computer multimedia hardware components.

## Further More
If there's still time left before the deadline, I would try to:
* Add more stages to the game
* Add different difficulties
* Add replay function
